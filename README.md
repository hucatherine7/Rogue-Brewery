# Rogue-Brewery
Rogue Ales is a brewery based in Oregon with with distributions to all 50 states. They brew their own innovative beers, many of the flavors local to the PNW with rotating seasonal flavors. 

This python code scrapes their beer list on their website: https://www.rogue.com/beers, iteratively finds the link to each page, then outputs each individual beer's Alcohol By Volume to a .csv file. 

This project is my initial attempt at web scraping using Python's Beautiful Soup Package. All work is done in Anaconda through Jupyter Notebook.
